# Development

* change command module design to match color theme

* 'evecuated' needs to change back to 'evac' - it stands for 'ready for evacuation please send a fucking ambulance/ to pick them up'

* readme for github


* responder UI needs light mode button

* simulate live info flowing in to the command mockup

* consider making the responder ui more intuitive with a single column of inputs like in version 1

* technical spike

* development plan and recommendations


* landing page with screenshots, context and all the hype
